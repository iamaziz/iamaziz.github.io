    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Early yesterday around noon in New York time [now: Mon Dec 29 18:58:39 EST 2014], the malaysian airlines flight QZ8501 has gone missing after about 42 minutes of its flight from Surabaya, in Indoensia, to Singapore.
Until this moment the ongoing search efforts have not been successful. Although, the Indonesian authorities reported that the airplane could be at the pot of the ocean. Other reports, said that an Australian navy airplane have spotted some unidentified objects somewhere in the south east of the Indian Ocean. However, all these reports came out of some speculations which have no solid ground; since no wreckage, no crash signs, and no evindence yet could solve the mystery of disappearance of the flight.</p>

<p>Just three minutes before the airplaneâ€™s signal disappear from the radars, the pilot had requested to change the flight altitude from 32,000 feet to 38,000 feet due to a severe storm. That was the last contact between the airplane and the Indonesian flight control as reported by Indonesian Officials. Although, his request was rejected, still no one knows what had happened after that.</p>

<h3 id="unpleasant-meomories">Unpleasant Meomories</h3>

<p>This incident brings back to memories the other tragic disappearance of flight MH370 less than ten months ago on March 8th, which has an unknown fate until today.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that both airplanes are owned by Malaysian based airlines. The two incidents also happened roughly in the same geographical area which is South East Asia. What a coincidence!! Could it be another Bermuda triangle in that part of the world?</p>

<p>All thoughts goes to the families for their missing.</p>

    <id>http:///blog/2014/07/18/setup-octopress-with-github-user-or-organization-site</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is how to setup <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> for using github pages as a host.</p>

<p>From your github account:</p>

<ol>
  <li>create a new repo and name it <code>username.github.io</code>, in my case <code>iamaziz.github.io</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Clone Octopress blog project and install dependencies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code>git clone https://github.com/imathis/octopress.git</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install dependencies:</p>

    <p><code>gem install bundler</code></p>

    <p><code>bundle install</code></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>From Octopress blog root folder:</p>

<ol>
  <li>run <code>rake setup_github_pages</code>, and ansewer with your repo credentials (the one you just created). (Note: make sure you have SSH key setup between your github account and your computer.)</li>
  <li>run <code>rake generate</code> (This will create your posts and pages)</li>
  <li>run <code>rake deploy</code> (This will push the contents of <code>_deploy</code> to your <code>master</code> branch).</li>
</ol>

<p>It should ask for your ssh key password (if it is not already saved in the keychain) then you will see something like <code>identity added: ...</code> and deployment will start.</p>

<h3 id="note">Note:</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>if you get a message says <code>permission denied</code> when you run <code>rake deploy</code>, this means SSH key (public key) does not exists or not establish correctly. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey">See: error permission-denied.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If everything is ok, your blog is ready at: <code>http://username.github.io/</code></p>

<h3 id="one-more-thing">One more thing:</h3>

<p>However, you also need to push the source of your Octopress project to <code>source</code> branch of your repo as follows, change directory to source folder and run:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>git add .</code></li>
  <li><code>git commit -m "your msg"</code></li>
  <li><code>git push origin source</code></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="done">Done!</h1>

<p>From now on you should be ready for blogging, as follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create and edit posts: <code>rake new_post["title"]</code></li>
  <li>Generate them: <code>rake generate</code></li>
  <li>deploy them to your github pages: <code>rake deploy</code> 
    <ul>
      <li>or <code>rake preview</code> to review it locally at <code>http://localhost:4000</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
